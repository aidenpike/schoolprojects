# Making-Change
Making Change is a coding assignment in my Computer Science class that was used to introduce the concept of variables in C++. It was assigned on ~September 16th, 2021.

## Refinements
- Made the code a lot cleaner in terms of indentation, and made it a little more efficent despite it not taking that much processing. 
- Made it to where all variables are defined upfront. 

## Additions
- Coded the entire assignment in C# (main.cs) as well, does the same thing as main.cpp.
- Added an if statement for scenario 2 where it yells at you if you did not give enough payment to what you have due.
