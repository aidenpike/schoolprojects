# Riddle Me Batman
Riddle Me Batman is the 2nd assignment we got when being taught conditionals. It features 3 difficulties you must code: easy, medium, and hard. Whichever difficulty you pick determines your riddle. It was assigned on October 15, 2021. 

## Refinements
- Made the code a lot cleaner in terms of indentation, and made it a little more efficent despite it not taking that much processing. 
- Made it to where all variables are defined upfront. 
- Made all capable conditionals shorthand.

## Additions
- Coded the entire assignment in C# (main.cs), does the same thing as main.cpp.
