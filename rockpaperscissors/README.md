# Rock Paper Scissors
This assignment was a combonation of everything we learned beforehand, a simple rock paper scissors script. It was assigned on November 26th, 2021.

## Refinements
- Made the code a lot cleaner in terms of indentation, and made it a little more efficent despite it not taking that much processing. 
- Made it to where all variables are defined upfront. 

## Additions
- Coded the entire assignment in C# (main.cs), does the same thing as main.cpp.
