# Coding Solutions to IPO Charts
This was the first coding assignment we were given for Computer Science. It has 3 scenarios, each one involving simple concept of in/out, as well as variables. This was assigned on August 31st, 2021.

## Refinements
- Made indentation a lot cleaner.

## Additions
- Added small detail: shorthand if/else statement for overdraft on scenario 1.
- Made each scenario name have color.

## The Assignment
Today you are coding solutions to the 3 scenarios from your first IPO Chart assignment. In the editor on the top left, I have the main function with a section of code for each scenarios. You will write your code where I have left the comment "You code here." The bottom left is the terminal which is where you will see the output of cout commands and where you can type in cin values to test your program. I suggest pulling up your first IPO chart assignment to help you with this assignment; however, I have posted the scenarios below as well. Good luck!

John Lee wants a program that allows him to enter the following three pieces of information: his checking account balance at the beginning of the month, the amount of money he deposited during the month, and the amount of money he withdrew during the month. He wants the program to display his balance at the end of the month.

Typing Salon currently charges $.10 per typed envelope and $.25 per typed page, although those prices may change in the future. The company accountant wants a program that will help her prepare the customer bills. She will enter the number of typed envelopes and the number of typed pages, as well as the current charges per typed envelope and per typed page. The program should display the total amount due from the customer.

The Limited wants a program that allows its sales clerks to enter the length and width (in feet) of a rectangle and the price of a square foot of tile. The program should display the area of the rectangle and the total price of the tile.
