# Random Numbers to Even Numbers
This assignment was a mixture of both sequential access files (inFiles and outFiles), and our last coding project before spring break of my sophomore year. It was assigned on March 28th, 2022.

## Refinements
- Made the code a lot cleaner in terms of indentation, and made it a little more efficent despite it not taking that much processing. 
- Made it to where all variables are defined upfront. 

## Additions
- Coded the entire assignment in C# (main.cs), does the same thing as main.cpp.
