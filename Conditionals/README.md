# Conditionals
Conditionals practice was our first assignment involving conditionals. It's 8 scenarios, and was assigned on September 31st.

## Refinements
- Made the code a lot cleaner in terms of indentation, and made it a little more efficent despite it not taking that much processing. 
- Made it to where all variables are defined upfront. 
- Made it to where all inputs can be placed on one line.

## Additions
- Coded the entire assignment in C# (main.cs), does the same thing as main.cpp.
