# Country Battle!
This assignment was our last project before the final for the end of the school year. It was assigned on May 13th, 2022.

## Refinements
- Made the code a lot cleaner in terms of indentation, and made it a little more efficent despite it not taking that much processing. 

## Additions
- Coded the entire assignment in C# (main.cs), does the same thing as main.cpp.
- winType() - What type of win did the player get? Ideas: Vassalize the enemy, eliminate the enemy, full conquer, initiate peace treaty
- Scientists who reduce the price of upgrading technology - Each scientist reduces price of a technology upgrade. 1 scientist per 2 territories; each round check how many territories each player has. Passive ability
