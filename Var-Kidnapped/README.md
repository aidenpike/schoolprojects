# Var-Kidnapped
Var-Kidnapped! Was the final assignment for the "Variables" chapter. It has 7 scenarios in a story-like fashion where you are kidnapped and must get back home. Each scenario's description will be below. This was assigned on ~September 16th 2021.

## Refinements
- Declared all variables upfront.
- Made it to where you can input multiple answers on 1 line for organization purposes. 
- Fixed the indentation.
- Added conditionals for small details like outputting dollar an hour instead of dollars an hour in the right condition.

# Additions 
- Coded the entire assignment in C# (main.cs), does the same thing as main.cpp.
