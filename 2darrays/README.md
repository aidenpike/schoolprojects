# Two Dimensional Arrays
This assignment was the introduction to two dimensional arrays in our array chapter. It was assigned on January 21st, 2022.

## Refinements
- Made the code a lot cleaner in terms of indentation, and made it a little more efficent despite it not taking that much processing. 
- Made it to where all variables are defined upfront. 

## Additions
- Coded the entire assignment in C# (main.cs), does the same thing as main.cpp.
